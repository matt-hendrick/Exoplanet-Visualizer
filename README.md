# Exoplanet Visualizer

[Exoplanet-visualizer.web.app](https://exoplanet-visualizer.web.app/) is a visualization of all discovered exoplanets (as of FEB/13/2023) pulled from the [NASA Exoplanet Archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/index.html). The visualization was built in TypeScript with Three.js.

## Features

The user can move through the visualization (centered on Earth). Clicking on an exoplanet will display a tooltip with information on the planet (planet name, right ascension, declination, and distance in parsecs). Right-clicking or middle-clicking will redirect the user to the exoplanet's page on the NASA Exoplanet Archive's website. There is a button to reset the camera's position to Earth and a button to toggle displaying XY and XZ grids (1 parsec x 1 parsec).
